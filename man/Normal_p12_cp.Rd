\description{
The \code{fitdistcp} package contains functions that generate predictive distributions
for various statistical models,
with and without parameter uncertainty.
Parameter uncertainty is included by using Bayesian prediction with a type of objective
prior known as a calibrating prior.
Calibrating priors are chosen to give predictions that give good reliability
(i.e., are well calibrated), for any
underlying true parameter values.

There are five functions for each model,
each of which uses training data \code{x}.
For model \code{****} the five functions are as follows:

\itemize{
\item \code{q****_cp} returns predictive quantiles at the specified probabilities \code{p},
and various other diagnostics.
\item \code{r****_cp} returns \code{n} random deviates from the predictive distribution.
\item \code{d****_cp} returns the predictive density function at the specified values \code{y}
\item \code{p****_cp} returns the predictive distribution function at the specified values \code{y}
\item \code{t****_cp} returns \code{n} random deviates from the posterior distribution
of the model parameters.
}
The \code{q, r, d, p} routines return two sets of results,
one based on maximum likelihood, and the other based on a calibrating prior.
The prior used depends on the model, and
is given under Details below.

Where possible, the Bayesian prediction integral is solved analytically.
Otherwise, DMGS asymptotic expansions are used.
Optionally, a third set of results is returned that integrates the prediction
integral by sampling the parameter posterior
distribution using the RUST rejection sampling algorithm.
}
\section{Optional Return Values}{


\code{q****} optionally returns the following:

If \code{rust=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ru_quantiles:} predictive quantiles calculated using a calibrating prior,
using posterior sampling with the RUST algorithm, based on inverting
an empirical CDF based on \code{nrust} samples.
}
If \code{waicscores=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{waic1:} the WAIC1 score for the calibrating prior model.
\item \code{waic2:} the WAIC2 score for the calibrating prior model.
}
If \code{logscores=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ml_oos_logscore:} the leave-one-out logscore for the
maximum likelihood prediction
(not available in EVT routines, for mathematical reasons)
\item \code{cp_oos_logscore:} the leave-one-out logscore for the
parameter uncertainty model
available in EVT routines, for mathematical reasons)
}
If \code{means=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ml_mean:} analytic estimate of the mean of the MLE predictive distribution,
where possible
\item \code{cp_mean:} analytic estimate of the mean of the calibrating prior
predictive distribution, where mathematically possible.
Can be compared with the mean estimated from random deviates.
}

\code{r****} optionally returns the following:

If \code{rust=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ru_deviates:} \code{nrust} predictive random deviatives calculated using a
calibrating prior,
using posterior sampling with RUST.
}

\code{d****} optionally returns the following:

If \code{rust=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ru_pdf:} predictive density calculated using a calibrating prior,
using posterior sampling with RUST,
averaging over \code{nrust} density functions.
}

\code{p****} optionally returns the following:

If \code{rust=TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ru_cdf:} predictive probability calculated using a calibrating prior,
using posterior sampling with RUST,
averaging over \code{nrust} distribution functions.
}
Selecting these additional outputs increases runtime.
They are optional so that runtime for the basic outputs is minimised.
This facilitates repeated experiments that evaluate reliability
over many thousands of repeats.
}

\section{Details (homogeneous models)}{

This model is a homogeneous model, and the \code{cp} results are based on the
right Haar prior.
For homogeneous models
(models with sharply transitive transformation groups),
a Bayesian prediction based on the right Haar prior
gives exact reliability,
as shown by Severini et al. (2002),
even when the true parameters are unknown.
This means that probabilities in the prediction will correspond to frequencies
of future outcomes in repeated trials (if the model is correct).

Maximum likelihood prediction does not give reliable predictions,
even when the model is correct, because it does not account for
parameter uncertainty.
In particular, maximum likelihood predictions typically underestimate the tail in repeated trials.

The reliability of the maximum likelihood and the calibrating prior
predictive quantiles produced by
the \code{q****_cp} routines in \code{fitdistcp} can be quantified
using repeated simulations with the routine \code{reltest}.
}

\section{Details (DMGS integration)}{

For this model, the Bayesian prediction equation cannot be solved analytically,
and is approximated using the DMGS asymptotic
expansions given by Datta et al. (2000).
This approximation seems to work well for medium and large sample sizes,
but may not work well for small sample sizes (e.g., <20 data points).
For small sample sizes, it may be preferable to use posterior
sampling by setting \code{rust=TRUE} and looking at the \code{ru} outputs.
The performance for any sample size, in terms of reliability,
can be tested using \code{reltest}.

The level of predictive probability matching achieved
by the maximum likelihood and calibrating prior quantiles, for any model,
sample size and true parameter values, can be demonstrated using the
routine \code{reltest}.

Model selection among models can be demonstrated using the routines
\code{ms_flat_1tail},
\code{ms_flat_2tail},
\code{ms_predictors_1tail},
and \code{ms_predictors_2tail},
