  logscores,
  x,
  t1,
  t2,
  ics,
  d1 = 0.01,
  d2 = 0.01,

\arguments{
\item{logscores}{logical that indicates whether to return leave-one-out estimates estimates of the log-score (much longer runtime)}

\item{x}{a vector of training data values}

\item{t1}{a vector of predictors for the mean}

\item{t2}{a vector of predictors for the sd}

\item{ics}{initial conditions for the maximum likelihood search}

\item{d1}{the delta used in the numerical derivatives with respect to the parameter}

\item{d2}{the delta used in the numerical derivatives with respect to the parameter}

\item{d3}{the delta used in the numerical derivatives with respect to the parameter}

\item{d4}{the delta used in the numerical derivatives with respect to the parameter}
