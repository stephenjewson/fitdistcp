\arguments{
\item{model}{which distribution to test. Possibles values are
"\code{gev}",
"\code{gpd_k1}",

\item{ntrials}{the number of trials to run. 5000 typically gives good results.}

\item{nrepeats}{the number of entire repeats of the test to run, to check for convergence. 3 is a good choice.}

\item{nx}{the length of the training data.}

\item{params}{values for the parameters for the specified distribution}

\item{alpha}{the alpha values at which to test}

\item{plotflag}{logical to turn the plotting on and off}

\value{
A plot showing 9 different reliability checks, and a list containing
various outputs, including the
probabilities shown in the plot.

\description{
This routine is mainly for reproducing certain results in Jewson et al. (2025),
and not of general interest.

It uses simulations to evaluate the reliability of
the predictive quantiles produced by the
\code{qgev_cp}, \code{ggpd_cp} and \code{qgev_p1_cp}
routines in the \code{fitdistcp} package.
For each model, results for 5 models are calculated.
This is to illustrate that the calibrating prior predictions dominate
the \code{ml}, \code{flat}, \code{crhp_ml} and \code{jp} predictions,
in terms of reliability.
}
\details{
The maximum likelihood quantiles (plotted in blue) do not give good reliability. They typically underestimate the tails (see panel (f)).

The \code{cp} predictive quantiles generally give reasonably good reliability, especially for sample sizes of ~100.
The other predictions generally give poor reliability.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
# example 1
# -runs the default settings, which test reliability for the GEV distribution
reltest2(nrepeats=1)

The level of predictive probability matching achieved
by the maximum likelihood and calibrating prior quantiles, for any model,
sample size and true parameter values, can be demonstrated using the
routine \code{reltest}.

Model selection among models can be demonstrated using the routines
\code{ms_flat_1tail},
\code{ms_flat_2tail},
\code{ms_predictors_1tail},
and \code{ms_predictors_2tail},
