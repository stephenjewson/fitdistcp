\title{Log scores for MLE and RHP predictions calculated using leave-one-out}
\usage{
halfnorm_logscores(logscores, x, fd1 = 0.01, aderivs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{logscores}{logical that indicates whether to return leave-one-out estimates estimates of the log-score (much longer runtime)}

\item{x}{a vector of training data values}

\item{fd1}{the fractional delta used in the numerical derivatives with respect to the parameter}

\item{aderivs}{logical for whether to use analytic derivatives (instead of numerical)}
}
\value{
Two scalars
}
